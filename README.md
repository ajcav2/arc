# Arc counter
This projcet aims to actively monitor the number of people at the arc by counting people entering and exiting.  An Arduino Uno will be utilized to monitor time-of-flight sensors set up in the turnstiles.  Information gathered by the Arduino is sent to a Raspberry Pi.  The Raspberry Pi can perform calculations and gather statistics to upload to a webpage.  The webpage is public and can be found at https://xx.xx.xx
